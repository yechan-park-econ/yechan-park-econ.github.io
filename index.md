Welcome! I am currently a predoctoral research fellow at [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) at Harvard University, working with Professors Raj Chetty, Isaiah Andrews, Susan Athey, and Guido Imbens. My research interests include econometric theory, applied econometrics, and machine learning.

In Fall 2025, I will begin the Ph.D. program in Economics at Harvard University. I received my B.A. in Economics from the University of Tokyo, where I was advised by Professor Hidehiko Ichimura.

Feel free to reach out anytime at [yechanpark@fas.harvard.edu](mailto:yechanpark@fas.harvard.edu)
